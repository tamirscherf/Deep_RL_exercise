In this tutorial, we will learn about Reinforcement Learning (RL), Deep Reinforcement Learning (deep RL), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. We will implement Q-learning and Actor-Critic models to perform different Multi-Armed Bandit tasks. For each model, we will compare the modelâ€™s performance with human subjects' behavior and see how likely the model is to perform as the subjects do.

Do all these terms sound like a recipe for a major headache? Good! Letâ€™s break it all down one by one ðŸ˜Š
